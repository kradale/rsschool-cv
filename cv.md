### About myself:

#### Currently I am a BI-analyst in Goodt. It is BI-platform on low-code development. My tasks - preparation and connection data, thinking through the functionality, create dashboards. 

#### In the course of work, I became interested in how our BI platform works, what lies "under the hood". It seemed to me that working on a website builder is much more interesting than building dashboards. That's why I'm here.
